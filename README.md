My code from [MIT's fall 2022 6.100L course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-100l-introduction-to-cs-and-programming-using-python-fall-2022/).
# summary
In Nov/2025, I started taking the online classes from this course on OCW. I have also been doing all suggested readings, in and out of class exercises, including problem sets. This repository will consolidate all my code from this coursework.
